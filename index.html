<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Piper Narendorf</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">
      <h1>I am... </h1>
      <h2>Piper Narendorf</h2>

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a senior studying Urban Planning and Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh. I came into college as a Sociology major and continued with it, and halfway through my second year, I tacked on my Urban Planning major to diversify my perspective. Throughout my time as an undergraduate, I have enjoyed taking courses such as Race and Racism Around the World and Urban Sustainability. I am also taking a class about the history of Black Pittsburgh, which I think will allow for a more holistic view of Pittsburgh and some of the history that is usually left out.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I have always considered myself to be a firmly qualitative person. I enjoy person to person interaction and conversations centered around community. As I have taken more courses, I have dabbled with the more quantitative side. I have good experience with GIS, or geographic information systems. I have also done a bit of coding with python. I would consider myself less a designer, and more a writer and a thinker. I would say words are the medium I am most practiced in, but my interests lie in photography and specifically film photography. I think the idea of limited chances and embracing imperfection is interesting. I think it can also add to the idea of imperfect design and something can always be changed or grown. I am not the most familiar with graphic design, so I hope to learn how to integrate it with some of my interests.</h3>
  </div>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>Most of my familiarity with design comes from the space of urban design and architecture and less from the realm of graphic design. Good design is something that is both visually stimulating and useful. There are many instances where things can look pretty but don't function well, and so I think good design marries the two ideas. In terms of graphic design, I know that these two ideas, visual interest and function, are just as important- it just manifests itself in different ways.</h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>The ultimate goal for me is to work in housing, specifically affordable housing efforts. However, i want to join the workforce for a bit before going back to get my masters in Urban Planning, and I would like to work as a GIS analyst. I think there are a lot of ways housing can be improved, and I believe housing is a fundamental right. I think all jobs to some extent need design expertise. There are facets of most careers that involve public facing work or writing for a specfic audience. Design is incredibly important in those scenarios because it demonstrates understanding. GIS is also something that is related to design because the output of the maps are made for a specific audience and communicating through font choices, color choices, and positioning can change the way that data is perceived.</h3>
